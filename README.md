# Renshu
Renshu is an application where you can practice Japanese words and verbs from the Duolingo words section. I created this application as a place to practice while I'm on the move.

## Goals
My initial goal is to create a environment where I can practice Japanese words/verbs. In the future I might expand it to sentences, Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji practice, etc. Or even expand it to other languages.
